## 🌱 This Repo Is a Derived Scraper

This repo is a **derived scraper** — it was generated from the [EPAM Systems International SRL Node.js Scraper](https://github.com/sebiboga/epam-systems-international-srl-nodejs-scraper) template.

This scraper scrapes job listings for **GUSTURI DIVINE S.R.L.** from ANOFM (Agentia Nationala pentru Ocuparea Fortei de Munca) and publishes them to peviitor.ro via the SOLR API.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository

3. Make your changes

## Code style

- ES modules (import/export)

- No hardcoded company identity — all configuration lives in `config/company.json`
